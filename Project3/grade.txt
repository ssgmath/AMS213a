Total Grade = 87/100

Part 1 = 20/20

	Notes: Well done!

QR Algorithm description = 10/20

	Notes:
	1) You go through the steps of the QR algorithm, but you don't address
	why A becomes the diagonal matrix of eigenvalues or why Q becomes the
	matrix of eigenvectors. -10 points. 

Part 2 = 20/20

	Notes: Well done!

Part 3 = 20/20

	Notes: Well done!

Report = 17/20

	Notes: Good job!
	1) You should use functions to describe the scale for compute time and
	the dimension of the Lehmer matrix. -1.
	2) You forgot to mention that LAPACK transforms A into its Hessenberg
	form. -2 points.
