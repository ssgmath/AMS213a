GS/GJ description: 5/5

	Notes: Well done!

CG description: 10/15

	Notes: 
	1) Your description of the CG algorithm is too vague. Constructing a basis
	iteratively isn't unique to CG. You should mention gradient descent or
	minimizing a quadratic polynomial as the motivating factor. -5 points.

Report: 20/20

	Notes:
	1) You should break up the plot with all the GS and GJ information. 
	It takes way too long too long to go back and forth and read your legend.

Extra Credit: 5/5
